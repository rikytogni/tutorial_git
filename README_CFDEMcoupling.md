## CFDEM®coupling-PUBLIC is no longer mantained - request a new version!

This repository contains only a free version of CFDEM®coupling (CFDEM®coupling-PUBLIC) and will not be updated in the foreseeable future.

DCS Computing GmbH is further developing CFDEM®coupling, which is now compatible with the DEM software [Aspherix®](https://www.aspherix-dem.com/).

For more information, please contact [DCS Computing](https://www.aspherix-dem.com/contact/).

## CFDEM®coupling-PUBLIC

CFDEM®coupling-PUBLIC provides an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework combining the strengths of LIGGGHTS® DEM code and the Open Source CFD package OpenFOAM® \*.

The CFDEM®coupling-PUBLIC allows to expand standard CFD solvers of OpenFOAM® \* to include a coupling to the DEM code LIGGGHTS®. In this toolbox the particle representation within the CFD solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organised in sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.), which can easily be selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. 

\* This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD Limited, the producer of the OpenFOAM software and owner of the OPENFOAM® and OpenCFD® trade marks.

## LIGGGHTS® version information
All LIGGGHTS® versions are based on a specific version of LIGGGHTS®, as printed in the file src/version.h. LIGGGHTS® versions are identidied by a version number (e.g. ‘3.0’), a branch name (which is ‘LIGGGHTS®-PUBLIC’ for your release of LIGGGHTS), compilation info (date / time stamp and user name), and a LAMMPS version number (which is the LAMMPS version that the LIGGGHTS®-PUBLIC release is based on). The LAMMPS “version” is the date when it was released, such as 1 May 2010.

</div>

If you browse the HTML doc pages on the LIGGGHTS®-PUBLIC website (https://www.cfdem.com/media/DEM/docu/Manual.html), they always describe the most current version of LIGGGHTS®-PUBLIC. If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they describe the version you have.
